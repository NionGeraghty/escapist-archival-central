It started out as a topic full of stuff that was not my business, and when it escalated, it never stopped changing. Even after I edited this video, more and more stuff was coming out, this time suggestions that the whole thing was caused by a handful of individuals trying to astroturf.&#xA;In any case, this video tries its best to isolate the core STATED issue from everything else, because discussing media bias and what that means in practical terms is an issue that's always interested me, even if it doesn't mean I intend to join the those howling corruption. Whether those who genuinely cared about ethics were being used cynically or not, I wanna talk about it. I also want to point out how those who care need to distance themselves from the harassment that HAS been happening, if only for the viability of their message.&#xA;For further reading, I said this thing about where I think real corruption lies. I don't think it lies with a handful of bloggers, especially the freelance ones who got attacked despite being isolated from the system.&#xA;This video likely won't satisfy a lot of you who wanted blood. I'm not your private attack dog, though. These are my thoughts and if they're not good enough, sorry about that. With this, I officially leave the topic. I stand with Ganondorf." />

Can you be manipulated by your own games?" />
